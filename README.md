# News-Genie

News-Genie is a web application designed to fetch and analyze news articles, providing users with insightful and up-to-date news information. The application is split into a backend, developed with Flask in Python, and a frontend built using React, with deployment managed through Vercel.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- `backend/`: Contains the Flask application with Python scripts for fetching and analyzing news.
- `frontend/`: Houses the React application, designed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the news content.

### Backend

The backend is structured as follows:

- `app.py`: Entry point for the Flask application.
- `database.py`: Manages database interactions.
- `news_analyzer.py`: Contains logic for analyzing news data.
- `news_fetcher.py`: Responsible for fetching news from various sources.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies for production.
- `requirements-dev.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies for development.

### Frontend

The frontend structure includes:

- `src/`: Contains all the source files for the React application.
  - `components/`: React components like `NewsCard.tsx` and `NewsFeed.tsx`.
  - `services/`: Services like `api.ts` which handle API calls to the backend.
  - `app.tsx`: The main React component that ties the application together.
  - `globals.css`: Global CSS styles.
